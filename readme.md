Have you ever wonder "chatgpt can code for you, why not let it make a whole project for you"
worry not, here is the alternative

To use

put OPENAI = key on .env

and change arguements on index.js function call


sometimes it doesnt work but just retry, i do have a beta version that enhance the json parsing so it 100% works, but some feature doesnt go as to plan for it, just dm me on discord if you want it
